## Project Description
The project plans to create "LoyolaFit," a new app for Loyola's Department of Recreation and Wellness (RecWell), to fix problems with the current IMLeagues software. People have complained about IMLeagues being hard to use, having too many ads, limited payment options, and making administrative work difficult. LoyolaFit aims to be easy to use and flexible enough to support different sports, fitness classes, and intramural leagues. Additionally, users will be able to complete required forms and pay their team dues on the platform. It will serve as a central location for RecWell's activities, allowing for easy customization of leagues and teams, making admin tasks smoother, and letting guests sign up for fitness and pool activities.

## Installation Instructions
There is no "installation" required in order to run and use the app. The only app that you are required to have on your computer is **Docker Desktop**. Since the application is dockerized and runs in a container, much like a virtual machine, this container handles all of the setup for you.

## How to Run
1. Clone the project repository using git to a location on your system as desired.
2. Open a command line/terminal window.
3. Navigate to the outtermost directory of the project `sportsmanagementsoftware/`
4. Run the command `docker compose up` in the terminal
5. Now if all goes well you should be able to access the frontent via <a href="https://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>
